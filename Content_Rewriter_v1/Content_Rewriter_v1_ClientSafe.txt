CONTENT REWRITER V1 (Client-Safe Version)

--- BEFORE ---
The appraisal process significantly impacted our home sale in a developing neighborhood. Our 2,400 sq. ft. landscaped home included upgrades no longer offered in current builds.

We listed at $XXX,XXX, reduced the price after a few weeks, and accepted an offer close to our reduced price. The inspection went smoothly with only a small repair needed.

The appraisal came in below the agreed price, using comparable properties that were smaller and lacked our features. Our location includes a large green space with scenic views, which was not reflected in the valuation. Evidence of a recent sale of the same floor plan at a higher price was dismissed for being over six months old.

Despite support from all parties except the lender and appraiser, the lower appraisal stood.

--- AFTER (Clean Rewrite, 120–180 words) ---
Our 2,400 sq. ft. landscaped home in a newer neighborhood featured upgrades not available in current builds. Initially listed above $XXX,XXX, we adjusted the price and accepted an offer after multiple showings. The inspection required only a small repair.

The appraisal returned significantly below the contract price, relying on smaller, less-featured comps. Our property backs onto a large green space with open views, a feature not accounted for in the valuation. We provided proof of a recent sale of the same floor plan at a higher price, but it was dismissed due to timing.

The county assessment closely aligned with our agreed price, but the lender and appraiser upheld the lower figure.

--- AFTER (Alt Version, 80–120 words) ---
We listed our upgraded home in a new development above $XXX,XXX, reduced slightly, and accepted an offer after multiple showings. Inspection was smooth, with only a small fix.

The appraisal came in lower than expected, using smaller, less-featured comps despite our premium location backing onto open green space. A recent sale of the same floor plan supported our value but was dismissed for being more than six months old.

The county’s assessment nearly matched our sale price, but the lender and appraiser disagreed.
