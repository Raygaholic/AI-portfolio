[MOCK SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER]
This is where a ChatGPT conversation screenshot would appear, showing:
1) The exact prompt used.
2) The AI-generated before/after output.
3) Time and date stamp.

Tip: For real screenshots, open ChatGPT in your browser, paste your prompt, run it, then take a screenshot (Shift+Command+4 on Mac).
