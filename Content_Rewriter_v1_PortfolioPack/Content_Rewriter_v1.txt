Appraisal ended up hurting us the most
Newer (still building) cookie cutter neighborhood in Texas. 2400 sq ft house that's landscaped wonderfully with some add ons that the new homes no longer have due to trying to squeeze maximum profits.

Started at 339k...dropped to 307k after a few weeks. Only three showings but all three were offers. Took the third offer and settled on 310k. Inspection went well, discovered a small leak on the hot water heater that they didn't request to be fixed but I had repaired.

Next up appraisal....a week later we were told its came in at 295k and the buyers don't have the extra funds to put more than 5% down.

All parties involved except for the lender and their appraiser feel its worth the 310k

The comp homes used is this neighborhood are 5-600 sq ft smaller and have less features and though all lots are small we have a 17 acre green space behind us with a pond and great distance views.

I did contact a person that lives in the neighborhood with the exact same floorplan after a public record search with the county and he verified that he bought his home within the past year for 313k gave all this info with deed screenshots with loan info to my realtor and she contacted the lender with it. The appraiser came back saying that example wasn't within the past 6 months so we are SOL, though originally said there weren't many comps in our neighborhood so he had to use what he could. Funny part is when he was here I explained that the house with the same floor plan was sold within the past year and I couldn't find out what it sold for (sold through builder) he kind of dismissed me and said he has more ways than I do to figure out what it sold for.

County assessment is 309.9k

Extremely frustrated but I think they broke me.

We listed our 2,400 sq. ft. landscaped home in a newer Texas neighborhood with upgrades no longer offered in the current builds. Originally priced at $339k, we reduced to $307k after a few weeks. Out of three showings, all resulted in offers — we accepted the third at $310k.

The inspection went smoothly, with only a small water heater leak, which we repaired. The setback came with the appraisal: it returned at $295k. The buyers, putting 5% down, couldn’t cover the difference.

The appraiser used comps that were 500–600 sq. ft. smaller and lacked our features. Our property also backs onto a 17-acre green space with a pond and scenic views. I found a recent sale of the same floor plan in our neighborhood for $313k, but the appraiser dismissed it because it was over six months old.

County assessment: $309,900. Despite support from all other parties, the lender and appraiser held firm.

We listed our 2,400 sq. ft. upgraded Texas home at $339k, dropped to $307k, and sold for $310k after three offers. Inspection went well; we fixed a minor water heater leak.

Appraisal came in low at $295k, using smaller, less-featured comps despite our prime location — a 17-acre green space with a pond and open views. I provided proof of a $313k sale of an identical floor plan, but it was dismissed for being over six months old.

County assessment sits at $309,900. Everyone but the lender and appraiser agreed the value was fair.
